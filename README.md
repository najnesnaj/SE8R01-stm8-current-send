# SE8R01-stm8-current-send

this uses a coil to measure the current on an AC powerline (up till 5 ampere)

the result is transmitted with a nrf24 similar module (the cheapest I could find, but it was not compatible, so had to adapt the code)


on the receiving side there is an orange pi single board computer -- see in opi-serial-to-mysql for the code
